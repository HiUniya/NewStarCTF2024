# Stress and Stay Calm

As we all know, recently we have a Capture The Flag competition called "NewStarCTF". During the competition, maybe we feel stressed and this easily make it difficult for us to think clearly when solving a problem. Let's expand to more areas. Whether in various competitions, communications, or the speeches I'm giving now, participants often experience similar phenomena called "choke" because of the stress. Why? And How to solve? This will be the topic of our discussion today.

## Why?

Physiologically, when we choke , our body has entered into protection from danger mode and has released a cocktail of stress-related hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These can elevate your breathing and heart rate,dilate your pupils, and even cause you to sweat. 

What's more, your working memory would be damaged when under threat.

It means that you have trouble understanding and acting on new information,become easier to recalling negative emotions, and consciously overthink what would happen next day.

At last, when choking, not only your performance in the moment decline, but it can also get  trapped in a vicious  circle. This will cause more serious problems of physical and mental.

Let's introduce a concept call "ego strengths", it refers to a person's ability or resources to keep his sense of self and integrate himself when facing difficulties, pressures, and conflicts. When the external demands or stress of the situation overwhelm your personal resources to cope with it, you're most likely to choke; A choke can also happen even when the pressure remains constant, yet your ability to use coping resources becomes depleted.

## How to solve?

The reasons we mentioned above, in more common terms, are that we cannot stay calm. So how can we stay calm and avoid choking?

First, it helps to practice under stressful conditions. 

In a study on expert dart players, researchers found that those who hadn't practiced under stress performed worse when anxious, compared to those who had become accustomed to stress.

Secondly, many performers extol the virtues of a pre-performance routine, whether it's taking a few deep breaths,  repeating a cue word or doing a rhythmic sequence of movements. 

Studies on golfing ,bowling, and water polo find that short rituals can lead to more consistent and accurate performance under pressure. 

And thirdly, researchers have shown that having an external focus on the ultimate goal works better than an internal focus, where someone is tuned into the mechanics of what they're doing. 

A study of experienced golfers revealed that those who hit chip shots while focusing on the flight of the ball performed significantly better than those who focused on the motion of their arms.  

So, perhaps we can modify that age-old saying: practice,under pressure,with focus, and with that glorious end goal in sight, makes perfect.
